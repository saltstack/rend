Rend 3
======

Rend 3 comes with a powerful new interface called block rendering. Block
rendering allows for files to be rendered in specific blocks, mix render pipes
and allow the upstream application using rend to read in bulk many rend files
and then decide how and when to render those files.

This feature was created with `idem` in mind, so that formulas can be rendered
later on, but it was not built specifically to work with `idem` of course!
The render block system allows for render pipes to be defined in a way that
exists outside of the specific render systems used and allows the block to
send key value data up to the ingesting application.

This new feature gives `rend` an amazing way to create dynamic data-driven
languages!
